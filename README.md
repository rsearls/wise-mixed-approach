WildFly 9.0.0.CR2 / WISE Mixed Approach 

This is a place to dump code for creating WISE (serverside) as a wildfly service using the
Mixed Approach.  (see https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/ExtendingAS7)

zipping up these files and unzipping then in a WildFly 9.0.0.CR2 branch should (eventually) work.

This project contains both WildFly and WISE file touched to this end.
It is a tempory workspace.
